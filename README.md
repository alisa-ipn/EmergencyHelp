Project:  Emergency Help!

Description:  
The app allows a user to discreetly ask for emergency help by sending a text message containing the user’s GPS coordinates as a link to a Google Map location.

For example,  if a person is being robbed or kidnapped, s/he does not have an opportunity to take a phone and to make a phone call in a regular manner.  However, our app allows sending an automatically generated text message to a predefined phone number (hard coded in this prototype version. However, the final version will include an option to predefine the destination number in Settings on the first use of the app) with a simple unnoticeable gesture, i.e. a long click on the screen. 

Requirements:
OS system  Android 4.2 - 4.4
Network Access

Detailed characteristics:
EmergencyHelp app runs in a full screen mode imitating  a black screen so the phone looks as if its inactivated so it would not drive attention of attackers. 
This gesture activates methods that would determine current user’s location through Network Operator and send a text message to a predefined number with a text  and a Google Map link with current position of the user.
